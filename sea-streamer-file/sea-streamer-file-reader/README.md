### `sea-streamer-file-reader`: File Reader for node.js

This library implements a decoder for the [SeaStreamer file format](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-streamer/tree/main/sea-streamer-file).

It does not provide the high-level Consumer interface. But the reason it is so complex in Rust is due to multi-threaded concurrency. Since node.js is basically single threaded, this made the implementation much simpler.

### Features

Lightweight. There are 0 dependencies. It only depends on the node.js standard library.

### Install

This package is published on npm as [`sea-streamer-file-reader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sea-streamer-file-reader).

### Running the `decoder`

```sh
npm run decoder -- --file ./testcases/consumer.ss
```
