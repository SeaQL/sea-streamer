//! ### `sea-streamer-redis`: Redis Backend
//!
//! This is the Redis backend implementation for SeaStreamer.
//! This crate provides a high-level async API on top of Redis that makes working with Redis Streams fool-proof:
//!
//! + Implements the familiar SeaStreamer abstract interface
//! + A comprehensive type system that guides/restricts you with the API
//! + High-level API, so you don't call `XADD`, `XREAD` or `XACK` anymore
//! + Mutex-free implementation: concurrency achieved by message passing
//! + Pipelined `XADD` and paged `XREAD`, with a throughput in the realm of 100k messages per second
//!
//! While we'd like to provide a Kafka-like client experience, there are some fundamental differences between Redis and Kafka:
//!
//! 1. In Redis sequence numbers are not contiguous
//!     1. In Kafka sequence numbers are contiguous
//! 2. In Redis messages are dispatched to consumers among group members in a first-ask-first-served manner, which leads to the next point
//!     1. In Kafka consumer <-> shard is 1 to 1 in a consumer group
//! 3. In Redis `ACK` has to be done per message
//!     1. In Kafka only 1 Ack (read-up-to) is needed for a series of reads
//!
//! What's already implemented:
//!
//! + RealTime mode with AutoStreamReset
//! + Resumable mode with auto-ack and/or auto-commit
//! + LoadBalanced mode with failover behaviour
//! + Seek/rewind to point in time
//! + Basic stream sharding: split a stream into multiple sub-streams
//!
//! It's best to look through the [tests](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-streamer/tree/main/sea-streamer-redis/tests)
//! for an illustration of the different streaming behaviour.
//!
//! How SeaStreamer offers better concurrency?
//!
//! Consider the following simple stream processor:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! loop {
//!     let input = XREAD.await;
//!     let output = process(input).await;
//!     XADD(output).await;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! When it's reading or writing, it's not processing. So it's wasting time idle and reading messages with a higher delay, which in turn limits the throughput.
//! In addition, the ideal batch size for reads may not be the ideal batch size for writes.
//!
//! With SeaStreamer, the read and write loops are separated from your process loop, so they can all happen in parallel (async in Rust is multi-threaded, so it is truely parallel)!
//!
//! ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeaQL/sea-streamer/main/sea-streamer-redis/docs/sea-streamer-concurrency.svg)
//!
//! If you are reading from a consumer group, you also have to consider when to ACK and how many ACKs to batch in one request. SeaStreamer can commit in the background on a regular interval, or you can commit asynchronously without blocking your process loop.
//!
//! In the future, we'd like to support Redis Cluster, because sharding without clustering is not very useful.
//! Right now it's pretty much a work-in-progress.
//! It's quite a difficult task, because clients have to take responsibility when working with a cluster.
//! In Redis, shards and nodes is a M-N mapping - shards can be moved among nodes *at any time*.
//! It makes testing much more difficult.
//! Let us know if you'd like to help!
//!
//! You can quickly start a Redis instance via Docker:
//!
//! ```sh
//! docker run -d --rm --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis
//! ```
//!
//! There is also a [small utility](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-streamer/tree/main/sea-streamer-redis/redis-streams-dump) to dump Redis Streams messages into a SeaStreamer file.
//!
//! This crate is built on top of [`redis`](https://docs.rs/redis).
