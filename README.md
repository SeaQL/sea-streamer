## Introduction

SeaStreamer is a stream processing toolkit to help you build stream processors in Rust.

We provide integration for Kafka / Redpanda behind a generic trait interface, so your program can be backend-agnostic.

SeaStreamer also provides a set of tools to work with streams via unix pipe, so it is testable without setting up a cluster,
and extremely handy when working with a local data set.

The API is async, and it works on `tokio` (and `actix`) and `async-std`.
