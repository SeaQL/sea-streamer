//!
//! SeaStreamer is a stream processing toolkit to help you build stream processors in Rust.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! 1. Async
//!
//! SeaStreamer provides an async API, and it supports both `tokio` and `async-std`. In tandem with other async Rust libraries,
//! you can build highly concurrent stream processors.
//!
//! 2. Generic
//!
//! We provide integration for Kafka / Redpanda behind a generic trait interface, so your program can be backend-agnostic.
//! Support for Redis Stream is being planned.
//!
//! 3. Testable
//!
//! SeaStreamer also provides a set of tools to work with streams via unix pipes, so it is testable without setting up a cluster,
//! and extremely handy when working locally.
//!
//! 4. Micro-service Oriented
//!
//! Let's build real-time (multi-threaded, no GC), self-contained (aka easy to deploy), low-resource-usage, long-running (no memory leak) stream processors in Rust!
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! `sea-streamer` is the facade crate re-exporting implementation from a number of sub-crates:
//!
//! + [sea-streamer-types](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-streamer/tree/main/sea-streamer-types)
//! + [sea-streamer-socket](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-streamer/tree/main/sea-streamer-socket)
//! + [sea-streamer-kafka](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-streamer/tree/main/sea-streamer-kafka)
//! + [sea-streamer-stdio](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-streamer/tree/main/sea-streamer-stdio)
