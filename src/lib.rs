//!
//! ## Introduction
//!
//! SeaStreamer is a stream processing toolkit to help you build stream processors in Rust.
//!
//! We provide integration for Kafka, Redpanda and Redis Stream behind a generic trait interface, so your program can be backend-agnostic.
//!
//! SeaStreamer also provide a set of tools to work with streams via unix file and pipe, so it is testable without setting up a cluster.
//!
//! The API is async, but the facade crate makes no assumption to the async runtime.
